# pizza-analysis-mySQL-PowerBI
This GitHub project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of a pizza store's sales data using MySQL and PowerBI. The project includes data preprocessing, SQL queries for data extraction, transformation, and visualization of key performance indicators (KPIs) related to the pizza store's sales and product performance.
# Pizza Store Data Analysis Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Pizza Store Data Analysis Project! This project utilizes the power of SQL for data extraction and transformation, along with Power BI for data visualization, to provide valuable insights into the operations of a fictional pizza store. In this README, you will find an overview of the project, its objectives, data sources, and key findings.

## Project Objectives

The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Data Extraction**: Utilize SQL queries to extract and transform data from the pizza store's database.

2. **Data Visualization**: Create insightful visualizations using Power BI to convey the key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends in the pizza store's sales data.

3. **Identify Insights**: Analyze the data to identify valuable insights related to sales, customer preferences, and operational trends within the pizza store business.

## Key Highlights

### Data Modeling and KPIs

- **Data Modeling**: The project involves data modeling to create a clear and structured view of the pizza store's data. This data model provides a foundation for accurate and meaningful analysis.

- **Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**: We have identified and measured various KPIs to assess the performance of the pizza store. These KPIs include total revenue, total pizzas sold, average order value, average number of pizzas per order, and more.

### SQL Queries

- **Data Extraction**: SQL queries are used to extract and transform data from the pizza store's database. This process includes creating views, modifying data types, and aggregating information to prepare it for analysis.

- **Insights**: The SQL queries are designed to extract relevant data points that are then used to generate valuable insights into the pizza store's sales and customer behaviors.

### Power BI Visualization

- **Visualization**: The heart of this project lies in the Power BI reports and dashboards. We have created visually appealing and interactive reports that allow stakeholders to explore the data and gain insights effortlessly.

- **Trends and Patterns**: Using Power BI, we highlight trends and patterns in pizza sales, customer behaviors, and operational aspects, making it easier for decision-makers to identify areas for improvement.

## Data Sources

The primary data source for this project is the `pizza_sales` database, which contains detailed information about pizza sales, orders, and pizza details. The data within this database is used to drive the analysis and generate visualizations.

## Key Findings

After a thorough analysis of the data and visualization of KPIs, the project has uncovered several key findings:

- **Revenue Insights**: We have identified trends in revenue, including peak sales hours, days, and months. This information can be used to optimize staffing and marketing efforts.

- **Customer Preferences**: The project sheds light on which pizzas are the most popular, both overall and by size, providing insights into customer preferences.

- **Operational Efficiency**: By examining the average order value and average number of pizzas per order, we can make recommendations to enhance operational efficiency.

## Conclusion

The Pizza Store Data Analysis Project combines the power of SQL data extraction, transformation, and Power BI data visualization to provide actionable insights for the pizza store business. We encourage you to explore the project's code, reports, and visualizations to gain a deeper understanding of the findings and how they can be used to drive business improvements.

Thank you for visiting our project, and we hope you find the insights valuable!
